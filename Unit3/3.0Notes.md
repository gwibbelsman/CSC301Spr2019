# Unit 3: Functions, and more SQL commands

Back in Unit 2, we learned a little about aggregate functions such as `count()` and `sum()`. Those are useful for compiling results for an entire table or subset of a table. 

Next, we will learn how SQL also has a bunch of other functions to help us manipulate how the data in our result set is displayed or how our queries run. The functions we will cover here are **non-aggregate functions**. They are applied on a row-by-row, column-by-column basis.

Later in sections 3.4 and 3.5, we will also learn about new ways to manipulate the data in the database. We saw 
some of these such as INSERT and UPDATE very briefly back in Unit 1, but here we will delve deeper.
