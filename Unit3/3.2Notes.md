# 3.2 String functions 
String functions work on textual data. Examples include ```concat()``` and ```substring()```, ```left()``` and ```right()```, ```trim()```, and so on. [Documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/string-functions.html)

### Example
Pull out the first_name and last_name columns, and concatenate them together with a space in between:
```sql
SELECT concat(first_name, ' ', last_name)
FROM employees;
```
Suppose we wanted to create email addresses for each employee. We can show how many string functions will work in concert to make this dream come true. 

First let's use ```left()``` to extract the first initial of the first name, then use ```concat()``` to concatenate it to the last name:
```sql
SELECT concat(left(first_name,1), last_name)
FROM employees;
```
Now let's use ```lower()``` to add the lowercasing and add onto ```concat()``` with the ```@company.com``` extension:

```sql
SELECT lower(concat(left(first_name,1), last_name, '@company.com'))
FROM employees;
```
