## 2.1 The WHERE clause
Adding a `WHERE` clause to the end of the statement will allow us to reduce the number of rows returned using some characteristic.

All the normal boolean operators you've seen elsewhere can be used here: >, <, >=, <=, ==, !=, <>, and with words, the keyword NOT can be used as well. 

Only show rows where someColumn equals 'foo':
```sql
SELECT firstname, lastname, birthdate
FROM someTable
WHERE firstname = 'Mary';
```

Only show birthdates over a certain date:
```sql
SELECT firstname, lastname, birthdate
FROM someTable
WHERE birthdate > '2002-12-31';
```

Only show information where the lastname is between these two values:
```sql
SELECT firstname, lastname, birthdate
FROM sometable 
WHERE lastname BETWEEN 'Anderson' AND 'Smith';
```

Only show first names that start with M:
```sql
SELECT firstname
FROM someTable
WHERE firstname LIKE 'M%';
```

Only show last names of people where the first name ends in m:
```sql
SELECT lastname
FROM someTable
WHERE firstname LIKE '%m';
```

Only show last names of people where the has an 'm' somewhere in the firstname:
```sql
SELECT lastname
FROM someTable
WHERE firstname LIKE '%m%';
```

Only show people that have no data for middle name:
```sql
SELECT firstname, lastname, birthdate
FROM someTable
WHERE middlename IS NULL;
```

Only show people that DO have data for middle name:
```sql
SELECT firstname, lastname, birthdate
FROM someTable
WHERE middlename IS NOT NULL;
```

Complex booleans are allowed:
```sql
SELECT firstname, lastname, birthdate
FROM someTable
WHERE middlename IS NOT NULL 
AND firstname LIKE 'M%';
```

```sql
SELECT firstname, lastname, birthdate
FROM someTable
WHERE firstname = 'Mary'
OR firstname = 'Maria';
```

Negation is allowed:
```sql
SELECT firstname, lastname, birthdate
FROM someTable
WHERE middlename IS NOT NULL 
AND firstname NOT LIKE 'M%';
```

More negation:
```sql
SELECT firstname, lastname, birthdate
FROM someTable
WHERE firstname != 'Melvin'; -- not equal to
```

And even more:
```sql
SELECT firstname, lastname, birthdate
FROM someTable
WHERE firstname <> 'Melvin'; -- not equal to
```

For complex logic queries, you must use the column name for both pieces. The following query is **incorrect**:
```sql
SELECT firstname, lastname, birthdate
FROM someTable
WHERE middlename LIKE '%n'
AND LIKE 'M%'; -- this is missing the column name for the second logical statement!
```

Here is the corrected version:
```sql
SELECT firstname, lastname, birthdate
FROM someTable
WHERE middlename LIKE '%n'
AND middlename LIKE 'M%'; 
```

But if you're looking for words like M%n, why not just do:
```sql
SELECT firstname, lastname, birthdate
FROM someTable
WHERE middlename LIKE 'M%n' -- this is an even better version
```
