## 2.4 LIMIT
`LIMIT` is a MySQL-only keyword that allows you to give a specific number of rows to be returned. 
```sql
SELECT *               -- select all rows
FROM someTable         -- from this table
WHERE lastname='Smith' -- only show a single last name
ORDER BY lastname ASC  -- put in alphabetical order
LIMIT 100;             -- only show 100 records
```

You can also specify the start point and how many records to return. This will return rows 51-150:
```sql
SELECT *
FROM someTable
LIMIT 50,100; -- only show rows 51-150
```
