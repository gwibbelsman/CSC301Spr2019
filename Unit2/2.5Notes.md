## 2.5 IN

The `IN` keyword can be used to create a set. This is helpful for `WHERE` clauses.

### Example: Show all the students who live in either NC, VA, or SC.
```sql
SELECT *
FROM students
WHERE state IN ('VA','NC','SC');
```
### Example: Show all the students who do NOT live in either NC, VA, or SC.
```sql
SELECT *
FROM students
WHERE state NOT IN ('VA','NC','SC');
```
