## Question 1: Professor Lupin's Patronus Database

The trick with this one is realizing that a student can have more than one patronus (but only one AT A TIME). If the question had said that a student could only have one patronus in their life, then we could just put a patronusID column in the students table and skip the M:N junction table.

> Another way to do the junction table here would be to NOT have a composite key, but instead create a synthetic key, then just have the two parent columns-in-common (student_id and patronus_id) as foreign keys back to their respective parent tables. In such a version of the diagram, the two parent tables stay exactly the same. 

## Question 2: Professor McGonagal's Human Transfiguration Database

This one is basically the same as the previous question, but it is worded differently.

## Question 3: Professor Snape's Test Database

> Here we have three basic nouns: students, tests, and questions. A test can have many questions, and a question can be on many tests, so we create a junction table (test_questions) to support this M:N relationship. The relationship between students and test_questions is similar. A student can answer many test_questions, and each test_question can be answered by many students, thus a junction table is created to store these. The PK of this table is the unique combination of a student, test, and question.

## Question 4: Sorting Hat's Dormitory Database

In the diagram below, the headsOfHouse columns in the teachers table are all nullable.

Here is an alternate partial diagram showing how to divide the teachers and heads of house into a 1:1 relationship. As described in [Unit 5.1 notes](https://github.com/megansquire/CSC301Fall2018/blob/master/Unit5/Unit5.1Notes.md#step-4-adding-cardinalities-to-each-relationship), 1:1 relationships are very rare.

This diagram shows a 1:1 relationship where each teacher might be the head of one house, or might not be the head of any house.
