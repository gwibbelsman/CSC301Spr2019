# Day 12 Lab: Normalization

## Goal
Practice database normalization into 3NF and create the associated ERD for that design.

## What to do 
1. Given the image below, produce a 1NF design for this data. In your 1NF design, put everything into one giant table. What are some candidate keys? (Hint: I used a Google spreadsheet to make my 1NF table.)
2. Is the resulting table also in 2NF? Why or why not? If not, produce a 2NF design for this data.
3. Is the resulting database in 3NF? Why or why not? Produce a 3NF ERD for this data in MySQL Workbench.

## What to turn in
Turn in a PDF file of your completed 3NF ERD. If you didn't get that far, paste in a link to a Google spreadsheet, or an actual spreadsheet file (i.e. Excel)
